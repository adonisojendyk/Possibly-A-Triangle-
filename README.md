# Possibly-A-Triangle-
Exercise from Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Liang. 
Class: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING 

6.19 - (input and output via dialog boxes) This program will pop up three dialog boxes each asking for one side of the triangle, this is done in the main method. Then the main method will determine if the 3 values produce a valid triangle by calling the isValid method. Based on the returned value from the isValid method the main method will either pop up a dialog box that says the values DO NOT make a valid triangle, but IF they do then the main method will call the area method and calculate the area of the triangle. If the area method is called then the main method will pop up a dialog box with the area of the triangle.
